Spectacular is a <abbr title='Behavior-Driven Development'>BDD</abbr> framework for CoffeeScript and JavaScript whose attempt to bring the power of RSpec to JavaScript. Spectacular try to favor the best practices used for writing [better RSpec tests](http://betterspecs.org/) in its design.

This is the kind of tests you can write with Spectacular:

```coffeescript
describe Array, ->
  given 'item', -> foo: 'bar'

  it -> should exist

  itsInstance 'length', -> should equal 0

  describe '::indexOf', ->
    context 'with an item not present in the array', ->
      itsReturn with: (-> [@item]), -> should equal -1

    context 'with an item present in the array', ->
      subject 'array', -> [@item]

      specify 'the returned value', ->
        expect(@array.indexOf @item).to equal 0
```

### Features, the short tour

  * Conditioned Specs
  * Matcher based description
  * Implicit subjects
  * Describe auto-subject
  * Factories
  * JSON and HTML fixtures (and more)
  * Promised-based tests run
  * Synchronous and asynchronous matchers
  * Synchronous and asynchronous tests
  * Browser support
  * Shared examples
  * Custom matchers
  * CSS-queries expressions to test the DOM content
  * Strings and objects diff in comparison results
  * The API is provided with both camelCase and snake_case version
  * No external dependencies in browsers

## Install

Spectacular is available as a [npm](http://npmjs.org) module, you can then install it with:

```shell
npm install -g spectacular
```

This will install Spectacular globally and allow you to use the Spectacular command line tool.

## Command-line

The most simple way to use the spectacular command line tool is as follow:

```shell
spectacular test specs/**/*.spec.js
```

### Commands

  <tr>
    <td>`test`</td>
    <td>Runs the tests on NodeJS.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>`server`</td>
    <td>Starts a server. The specs can then be accessed from a browser at the the following address: `http://localhost:5000`. The default port can be changed by setting the `PORT` environment variable.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>`phantomjs`</td>
    <td>Assuming you have PhantomJS installed, it will starts a server and run the test on PhantomJS.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>`slimerjs`</td>
    <td>Assuming you have SlimerJS installed, it will starts a server and run the test on SlimerJS.</td>
  </tr>

## Contributing

I decided to start using the [AngularJS commit messages convention](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit) for this project. Please use the same convention as well for commits in PR.

I also try to follow Nvie's [Successful Git Branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Meaning that I do the daily work in
the `develop` branch and try to keep the `master` branch with only the released
versions. All the pull request should be done to the `develop` branch.
